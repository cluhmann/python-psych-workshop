# Introduction to Python

Materials for **Introduction to Python** workshop, presented at the Association for Psychologiccal Science, May 2018.

Python is a free, general-purpose programming language.  Two of Python's main assets are its beginner-friendly syntax and its expansive library of third-party packages (Python's "ecosystem").  Within this ecosystem are a set of integrated packages providing behavioral scientists with what amounts to an end-to-end data-collection and data-processing pipeline.  The packages in this pipeline provide functionality including the creation of behavioral experiments (both those conducted in the laboratory and online), data wrangling (e.g., dealing with missing data, outliers, etc.), data exploration (both desciptive and visual), statistical analysis (both frequentist and Bayesian), machine learning techniques (e.g., classification, clustering, etc.), and even the generation of publication-quality figures.

The workshop targets a general audience, assuming no prior familiarity with Python.  Structurally, the workshop includes a brief introduction to the Python language, followed by a systematic series of illustrative examples follow a single data set as it makes its way through the data pipeline.  Ways in which researchers can integrate only a portion of the pipeline into their existing data flow (e.g., importing/exporting a variety of data formats) are highlighted as are tools of particular use in teaching contexts.

## Goals of the workshop
* Cultivate an awareness and an appreciation of the benefits of Python, particularly the benefits for academic behvaioral scientists
* Highlight functionality provided by Python and its ecosystem
* Note how these tools can be integrated into existing workflows

## Non-goals of the workshop
* Ability to program Python without further work
* Encyclopedic knowledge of ecosystem, APIs, etc.
